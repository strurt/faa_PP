 Progressive passes are dribbles or runs made by a player that advance the ball forward a considerable distance, often surpassing multiple opponents. Here ,we will consider open play passes that move the ball more than twenty five percent closer to the goal as an open pass. We compute the distance betwen the starting point of the pass and the ending point of the pass using the distance formula and in the end if th end point is 25 percent closer to the goal than it initially was, we consider the pass as progressive

Here, we calculate the progressive pass for a specific player of a specific team during a specific game . 

Packages used : pandas, numpy, matplotlib, mplsoccer

steps involved: 
import the packages and the dataset
clean the data
use distance formula to calulate the coordinates 
plot the progressive passes that a specific player made in the game
